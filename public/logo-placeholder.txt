This is a placeholder for the logo image.

To use a real logo:
1. Create a square logo image (recommended size: 512x512 pixels)
2. Save it as "logo.png" in the public folder
3. Make sure the logo has a transparent background for best results

The logo should represent the watermarking application and match the blue color scheme.
